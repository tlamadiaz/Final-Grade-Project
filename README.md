# Final-Grade-Project
Script for the analysis of 23 chromosmes using 1000 genomes phase 3 data, which can obtain:

    Total number of SNVs, cSNVs, SNPs and cSNPs. 
    Frequency per pair base of that variants.
    Transition - transversion rate of that variants.

It's necessary to download bed file to define coding regions from the USCS browser.
